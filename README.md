This Repository contains the git for the Scientific Computing Project Code Bc1-5 created by Trevor Nutt ID# 1387058.

The main code contains both Explicit and Implicit methods for solving the equation with the proposed boundary conditions.
The second method (implicit) is comment locked (needs to be unlocked) before it will run. Make sure to lock the original explicit
method code before doing so.
